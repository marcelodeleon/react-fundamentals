# 04 Summary - Custom React Components

We saw how to create custom components with React, first understanding the
underlying mechanisms used by React (rendering the component with a function).
After that we took incremental steps until we ended up with using our
components in JSX, which is how we'll be using them moving forward.

Also, we worked our way through type checking our components' properties
using PropTypes (first with a custom implementation and then with the package)
and saw how to use React Fragments to be able to place two sibling components
without the need to create a wrapping container.
