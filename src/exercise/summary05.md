# Styling

We saw the different ways to style a React component using `className` and
`style` props, and we saw how to override them inside the component.
Also, we were introduced to the idea of leaving the style mechanics as an
implementation detail, and provide the user with an API to control how the
component should look. In this case, passing the size as a prop.
